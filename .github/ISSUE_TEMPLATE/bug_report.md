Please write in English. All new non-English topics will be automatically deleted. Respect other people!
Read the description and FAQ before writing something here.
All messages that are answered in the FAQ will be deleted.
Instead, if you are reporting a bug, please include in the report:
- The version of CSSA and Factorio
- Other mods in the game
- If CSSA was added after start of the game
- A brief description of what you are experiencing
- A brief description of want you are expecting
- If you got a crash, the log file "factorio-current.log" will be very helpful

Try to use the latest version of CSSA and Factorio before post a bug report, if you haven't the latest version, your bug could be already fixed!

I hope there won't be any, but you'll never know!

If there is any bug, then do the following:
1. Open your file explorer in windows (windows + e).
2. Type %appdata%/Factorio into the file explorer's path input text and pres return.
3. Go to https://github.com/Ismoh/factorio-coop-secure-spawn-areas-mod/issues and click on 'new issue'.
4. Insert a title, which describes your problem best and leave there a description in the comment section.
5. Don't forget to add your "factorio-current.log" to the issue, which you find at bullet point 2.

Thank you very much!
